# ChessAI - **Non-Functional Project**

**Warning:** This project is currently **non-functional** and under development. Use at your own risk.

## Project Description

ChessAI is a project created to provide **real-time chess game analysis** directly on [Chess.com](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://www.chess.com). Utilizing the powerful Stockfish engine and the flexibility of Python, this tool was intended to assist players by suggesting optimal moves during gameplay.

**Important:** This project should be considered **experimental and non-functional**. It is not intended for use as a fully operational "cheat" or to gain an unfair advantage in chess games. Development is currently paused, and **functionality is not guaranteed** at this time.

**Disclaimer:** The developer assumes **no responsibility** for any consequences that may arise from the use of this project. This includes, but is not limited to, account suspensions on Chess.com or any other platform, misinterpretation of analysis, or any other unintended outcomes. Use this project at your own discretion.

## Features (Planned but not fully implemented)

  * **Real-time Analysis:** The program was intended to analyze the current chess position on Chess.com in real-time.
  * **Move Suggestions:** Based on Stockfish analysis, the program was supposed to suggest the best moves for the player.
  * **Chess.com Integration:** The tool was designed to work directly within a browser while Chess.com is open.

## Technologies

  * **Stockfish:** A powerful open-source chess engine used for position analysis and move calculation.
      * [Stockfish Official Website](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://stockfishchess.org/)
  * **Python:** The programming language used to create the core logic and integration.
